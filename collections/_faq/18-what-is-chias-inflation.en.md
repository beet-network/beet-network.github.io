title: "What is Beet’s inflation?"
---

After the Beet pre-farm, Beet offers farming rewards of 64 beet every 10 minutes. Over the first 12 years the farming rewards will be halved at the end of each 3rd year. From year 13 to infinity, the rewards will remain constant at 4 beet every 10 minutes leading to ever decreasing inflation rates. Beet’s inflation falls through the 0.50% rate 22 years after mainnet launch.
