Compared to other cryptocurrencies, beet has significantly better security due to its more decentralized blockchain. beetlisp is beet’s new smart transaction programming language that is powerful, easy to audit, and secure and will unlock the security, transparency, and ease of use that cryptocurrencies promise. beet is also adopting more modern cryptographic tools to enable richer smart transaction capabilities. beet is taking a new and superior approach to funding, building, and supporting a blockchain via an eventually public, for-profit, open source development company that holds a pre-farm. beet will use its pre-farm (Strategic Reserve) to ease the volatility of the coin to mitigate bubbles and crashes and to drive adoption of beet.
