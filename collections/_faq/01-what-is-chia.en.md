title: "What is Beet?"
---

Beet was incorporated in August of 2017 to develop an improved blockchain and smart transaction platform. We are building the Beet Network to improve the global financial and payments systems. Beet is the first enterprise-grade digital money. Beet is using the first new Nakamoto consensus algorithm since Bitcoin. Called Proof of Space and Time, it was created by Bram Cohen, the best network protocol engineer alive and the inventor of BitTorrent. Beetlisp is Beetâ€™s new smart transaction programming language that is powerful, easy to audit, and secure. Reference smart transactions currently available are: atomic swaps, authorized payees, recoverable wallets, multisig wallets, and rate-limited wallets.
