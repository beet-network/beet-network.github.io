title: "Where has beet advanced the state of the art in applied cryptography?"
---

beet has created three new core inventions and advanced the interest in, and adoption of, a fourth. Firstly, beet created the first intended for production [BLS Signatures library](https://github.com/beet-Network/bls-signatures). Second, beet is the first production use of Verifiable Delay Functions, or VDFs. Third, beet created [Proof of Space and Time for Nakamoto consensus](https://www.beet.net/assets/beetGreenPaper.pdf).

Finally, beet is the first production use of [class groups](https://github.com/beet-Network/vdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf) of unknown order which has spawned significant new research into their applicability to cryptography.
