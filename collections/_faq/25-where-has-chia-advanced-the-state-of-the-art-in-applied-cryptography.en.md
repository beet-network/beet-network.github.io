title: "Where has Beet advanced the state of the art in applied cryptography?"
---

Beet has created three new core inventions and advanced the interest in, and adoption of, a fourth. Firstly, Beet created the first intended for production [BLS Signatures library](https://github.com/Beet-Network/bls-signatures). Second, Beet is the first production use of Verifiable Delay Functions, or VDFs. Third, Beet created [Proof of Space and Time for Nakamoto consensus](https://www.beet.net/assets/BeetGreenPaper.pdf).

Finally, Beet is the first production use of [class groups](https://github.com/Beet-Network/vdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf) of unknown order which has spawned significant new research into their applicability to cryptography.
