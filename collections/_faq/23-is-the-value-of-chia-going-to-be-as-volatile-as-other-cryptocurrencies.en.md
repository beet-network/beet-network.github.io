title: "Is the value of beet going to be as volatile as other cryptocurrencies?"
---

We believe that beet coins will be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies due to the planned nature of our planned public company status which will allow financial institutions to hedge and leverage coins and equity. Initially, we expect beet Network to largely be valued based upon the valuation of the beet that the Company will hold on its balance sheet. Movements in the price of beet on digital exchanges are likely to be mirrored by price movements in the price of our stock on a stock exchange. There will be more ways to get exposure to the success of beet than traditional blockchain projects. This will also allow the usual options and derivatives to our stock to be used as something like a synthetic derivative for the price of beet coins. Additionally, our ability to use the beet Strategic Reserve may reduce some volatility of beet in the market.
