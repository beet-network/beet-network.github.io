You should first read the [repository FAQ](https://github.com/Beet-Network/beet-blockchain/wiki/FAQ), check out the wealth of information on the [repository wiki](https://github.com/Beet-Network/beet-blockchain/wiki/) and  join us on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/beet_network.public) in the #testnet or #beginner channels. We have also created a good [summary of the basics of creating plots](https://www.beetnetwork.org/2021/02/22/plotting-basics.html) for Beet.
