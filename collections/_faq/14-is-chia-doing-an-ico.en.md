title: "Is beet doing an ICO?"
---

No. beet is not planning an ICO. Instead, our goal is to take the companyâ€™s equity public on an American stock exchange. This way, shareholders can share risk and return with management with transparency and disclosure and we can use well understood corporate controls to make binding statements about how beet Network intends to use the Strategic Reserve. The beet digital money is meant to be a useful payment instrument and not an investment opportunity. beet intends to complete a fully compliant SEC registered equity IPO and will come to market as market-timing is amenable after the launch of mainnet.
